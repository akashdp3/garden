## Notes

### Abroad Move
I always take risk and like to run like a cowards towards something bigger so that the risk does not become a risk anymore. I am thinking of doing it again. 
  
I have a taken a gamble by buying a flight. I have no fucking clue how it is gonna turn out. Even after 9 months, I don't know if I have a correct decision. The only way I could think a way out is to move abroad. 
  
There are two reasons for moving abroad:
- Better opportunity and better life style
- More money 
- Taking the house as the investment rather than staying
