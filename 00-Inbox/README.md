# 00-Inbox

## Purpose

This is your **capture zone** - where everything starts.

## What Goes Here

1. **Daily Journals** - Create your daily notes here
2. **Quick captures** - Random thoughts, ideas, links
3. **Meeting notes** - Before processing to projects
4. **Fleeting notes** - Anything you need to capture quickly

## Workflow

### Daily Notes
- Create today's journal entry here
- Keep this week's daily notes accessible
- Process weekly: extract insights to Zettelkasten, tasks to projects

### Processing (Weekly Review)
- Review all notes in Inbox
- Move project-related items → `10-Projects/`
- Move area-related items → `20-Areas/`
- Move reference material → `30-Resources/`
- Extract timeless insights → `50-Zettelkasten/`
- Archive old daily notes → `40-Archive/DailyNotes-2025/`
- Delete what's no longer needed

## Keep It Clean

The Inbox should be **temporary storage**. If notes have been here more than a week, process them during your weekly review.
