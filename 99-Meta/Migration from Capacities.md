## Folder Mapping

| Capacities Folder | Obsidian Location | Reason |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Projects/ | 10-Projects/ | Active work with deadlines |
| Backburners/ | 20-Areas/ | Ongoing areas, not time-bound |
| Blogs/ | 10-Projects/ | Active blog writing project |
| Books/ | 30-Resources/Books/ | Reference and learning material |
| DailyNotes/ | 40-Archive/DailyNotes-2025/ | Historical daily logs |
| Meetings/ | 10-Projects/[Project Name]/ | Meeting notes linked to projects |
| Pages/ | 30-Resources/ | General reference pages |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review migrated content** - Check if notes are in the right locations
2. **Update internal links** - Capacities used `[[]]` links; verify they work in Obsidian
3. **Add cross-links** - Link projects to related Zettelkasten notes
4. **Clean up metadata** - Capacities YAML frontmatter may need adjustment

### Ongoing Workflow

1. **Start using 00-Inbox** for new captures
2. **Process inbox weekly** during review
3. **Extract insights** from project notes into Zettelkasten
4. **Archive completed projects** when done
5. **Build Zettelkasten** by adding atomic notes as you learn

### Optional Enhancements

- Create project templates in 90-Templates/
- Set up daily note template
- Create Maps of Content (MOCs) for major topics
- Install Obsidian Git plugin for backup
- Add more Zettelkasten notes from book notes

## Original Structure Preserved

The original `capacities-notes/` folder remains untouched at:
`/Users/aa/Documents/garden/capacities-notes/`

You can delete it once you've verified the migration is complete.

## Migration Notes

- All files copied (not moved) to preserve originals
- Daily notes archived as they're historical
- Project structure maintained where possible
- Zettelkasten notes created as examples of atomic note-taking
- Metadata from Capacities preserved in YAML frontmatter
