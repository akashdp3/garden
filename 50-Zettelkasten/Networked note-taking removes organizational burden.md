# Networked note-taking removes organizational burden

Linking notes creates a network of ideas, reducing the need for rigid folder hierarchies and enabling emergent organization.

## Key Insight

Traditional note-taking requires upfront decisions about where to file information (which folder? which category?). This creates:
- Decision paralysis when capturing ideas
- Artificial boundaries between related concepts
- Rigid structures that don't match how ideas connect

Networked thinking replaces this with:
- Create notes freely, link as you go
- Let organization emerge from connections
- Multiple pathways to the same information

## How It Works

Instead of asking "Where does this belong?", ask "What does this connect to?"
- Create backlinks automatically
- Visualize connections in graph view
- Discover unexpected relationships

## Trade-offs

- Requires trust in the system
- Initial learning curve
- Adds space for creative thinking
